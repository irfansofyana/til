## What I Learned

A few days ago, I came across an interesting article about the paid subscriptions used by a staff engineer. You can find the article here: [The 5 Paid Subscriptions I Actually Use in 2025 as a Staff Software Engineer](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-5-paid-subscriptions-i-actually-use-in-2025-as-a-staff-software-engineer-98033c94566e).

Most of the tools mentioned in the article were already familiar to me, except for one: Kagi. Intrigued, I decided to explore what Kagi is all about.

[Kagi](https://kagi.com) is essentially a search engine with pricing plans that offer an improved experience and enhanced privacy. Unlike Google Search, which relies on ads for revenue, Kagi takes a different approach by offering subscription-based plans, avoiding ads altogether. This appealed to me, as the increasing number of ads on Google has noticeably impacted the search experience.

The references I read about Kagi were overwhelmingly positive, which encouraged me to give it a try. I opted for the professional plan, which costs around $10/month. So far, the experience has been excellent. I plan to utilize it as much as possible and may write more posts about my experience in the future.
