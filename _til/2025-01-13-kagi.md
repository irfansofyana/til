## What I learned

Few days ago I found an interesting article about what are the paid subscriptions that he is using as a staff engineers. The article is here: [The 5 Paid Subscriptions I Actually Use in 2025 as a Staff Software Engineer](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-5-paid-subscriptions-i-actually-use-in-2025-as-a-staff-software-engineer-98033c94566e)

Almost all the specified tools there I already know except about kagi. So I decided to learn about Kagi and try to find out what is it.

[Kagi](https://kagi.com/) technically is a search engine with some pricing plans, it is offering a better experience and better privacy for searching and getting answers to your questions. Google search is dying because of ads but that's how they are making money. Kagi is different, instead of ads, they are offering paid plans.

Many references I read give a good impressions about Kagi. I decided to purchase a professional plan that cost me around 10$/month. So far so good, I will try to utilize it as much as I can and perhaps will create more post about it.
